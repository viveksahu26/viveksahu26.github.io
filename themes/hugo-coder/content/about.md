Hey, great to see you here. I am Vivek!

I'm passionate about open-source software(basically I love OSS). At present to secure OSS actively contributing to improve the software supply chain security with a strong focus on SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) via OSS tooling at Interlynk. I contribute to and maintain several open-source projects like [sbommv](https://interlynk-io/sbommv), [sbomqs](https://interlynk-io/sbomqs), and [sbomasm](https://interlynk-io/sbomasm), and stay actively involved in the broader SBOM community.

I have been involved in the Software Supply Chain Security since 2024 and will continue to dig more into it. Along with managing Open Source projects of the company looking forward to be active to the OpenSSF community as a contributor/maintainer to some of the projects. At the end, Open Source is fueled by hobbist programmers, loves for community and oen who care about paying back to the community in one o another form. At the end "Open Source is not a free beer, it's a free puppy, which requires care in return".

I previously worked as a Junior SRE & Go developer at Obmondo. And even prior to that, I started my tech journey as a entrypoint in form of contributor to CNCF projects like Kyverno, kyverno-policies and KubeArmor. So far, my path has been strongly oriented toward open source, which continues to be a central focus of my carrier so far.
